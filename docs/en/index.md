# Welcome to MIP! 🚀

**MIP** (MInimal Package Manager) is a lightweight and fast package manager for Node.js, written in clean JavaScript.

::: callout info "What is MIP?" icon:info
MIP is an alternative to npm, pnpm, and yarn. It’s faster, simpler, and requires fewer resources. Unlike other package managers, MIP uses a **global cache**, does not create `node_modules/`, and supports **plugins**.
:::

## 🎯 Key features

- **🚀 Speed** - installs packages several times faster thanks to parallel downloads, HTTP/2, and a three-level cache.
- **📦 Global cache** - packages are stored once in `~/.mip/store/` and used by all projects. Saves space and speeds up installs.
- **🔌 Plugins** - extend MIP functionality with plugins. Create your own commands, subscribe to events, and integrate with external services.
- **📝 YAML configuration** - instead of `mip.json`, use `mip.yml` and `mip-lock.yml`. Human-readable, supports comments, and is pleasant for manual editing.
- **🔒 Security** - built-in dependency auditing and vulnerability checks.
- **🌍 Multilingual UI** - supports 10 interface languages.
- **📁 Monorepos** - built-in workspaces support.
- **🔧 Flexibility** - works with both global and local packages, supports `package.json` for npm compatibility.
- **🧩 Your own registry** - publish and install packages from your own registry.

## ⚡ Quick start

```bash
# Install MIP
git clone https://github.com/kiwinatra/mip
cd mip
npm install
npm run build

# Create a new project
mip init
mip install express
mip run start
```

::: tip "💡 Tip"
After building, MIP will suggest adding itself to `PATH` so you can run it from any folder.

## 🧩 How it works

MIP uses a **global cache** (`~/.mip/store/`) where it stores all package versions. This enables:
- Installing packages without duplication.
- Instantly switching between versions.
- Working without the internet if the package is already in the cache.
- Saving up to 90% of disk space.

**No `node_modules/`** - instead, MIP uses symlinks to the global cache and a `.mip/manifest.json` manifest to track installed packages.

├── mip.yml             # Project configuration (YAML)
├── mip-lock.yml       # Locked package versions (YAML)
├── .mip/
│   ├── manifest.json  # Installed packages manifest
│   ├── cache/         # Download cache
│   └── packages/      # Local packages (if any)
└── node_modules/      # Symlinks to the global cache

## ❓ Frequently asked questions

**How is MIP different from npm?**
MIP is faster, simpler, and doesn’t require complex setup. It uses a global cache, doesn’t create `node_modules/`, supports plugins, and uses YAML configuration.

**Can I use MIP in CI/CD?**
Yes. There is a `mip ci` command designed for automated builds and supporting `--frozen-lockfile`.

**How do I update MIP?**
Rebuild the project from the repository and reinstall.

**Does MIP support `package.json`?**
Yes. MIP is fully compatible with `package.json`. You can use MIP in any npm-based project.

**How do I migrate from an old `mip.json`?**
On the first run, MIP automatically migrates `mip.json` to `mip.yml` and creates a backup.
